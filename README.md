# steel-clash: A 3D Action Adventure Game

**steel-clash** is a third-person action-adventure game built in **Unity**. It features a third-person melee fighter who must navigate through three unique levels filled with increasingly dangerous enemies. Players must combine strategic blocking, swift attacks, and timely dodges to survive. Along the way, they can collect power-ups, including health packs and temporary damage boosts, to gain an edge in combat. Each level concludes with tougher enemies, culminating in an intense boss battle.
